# 📝 React To-Do App with API Integration

A fully functional **To-Do application built with React and TypeScript** that interacts with a remote API to manage tasks in real time. This app focuses on clean UI/UX, asynchronous operations, and persistent data handling.
The goal of this project is to implement a responsive and intuitive To-Do manager where all data is synchronized with a remote API. The app is built in stages, covering loading, creating, updating, deleting, and filtering todos — ensuring both technical correctness and a smooth user experience.
The implementation passes all required test scenarios.
